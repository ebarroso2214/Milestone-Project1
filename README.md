## Project Description

This project I'm making will be a platformer type of game, inspired by my love for the beautiful game which we call Soccer/Football. Ultimately the goal of this game is for you to win the World Cup. The premise of the game is no different than other platformers. You avoid enemies, and try to make it to the end of the map to win.

## Game Logic

```


  - What are the choices available to the player?
    moveLeft, moveRight,moveUp, moveDown
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
  
    moveUp will move the user forwards towards the top of the map when W key is pressed.
    
    moveDown will move them closer to the start of the map when S key is pressed.
    
    moveLeft will move the player to the left when the A key is pressed
    
    moveRight will move the player to the right when the D key is pressed
    
    playerCollison will be collision properties for the boundary, the NPC's, and the goal
    
    playerStop will stop the character from moving happen when no key is pressed.
    
    playerWin will display an alert when the player beats the game by hitting the goal zone
    
    playerLoss will display an alert that the player lost when the player either hits the NPC's or the boundaries around the field and will ask the player to try again.
    
    playerScore is whenever the user scores the goal by hitting the goal zone
    
    winnerMessage will display a message saying the user has won and prompt them to try again
    
    loserMessage will display a message saying the user has lost and will prompt them to try again


```


### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
    A nice background
- Another that will be a stretch.
    randomized moving NPC's
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... _yet_. :)
    Make a cutscene
