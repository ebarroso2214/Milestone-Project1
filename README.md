# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

This project I'm making will be a platformer type of game, inspired by my love for the beautiful game which we call Soccer/Footbal. Ultimately the goal of this game is for you to win the World Cup. The premise of the game is no different than other platformers. You avoid enemies, and try to make it to the end of the map to win.

## Game Logic

```

The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
    moveLeft, moveRight,moveUp, moveDown
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
    moveUp will move the user forwards towards the top of the map when W key is pressed.
    moveDown will move them closer to the start of the map when S key is pressed.
    moveLeft will move the player to the left when the A key is pressed
    moveRight will move the player to the right when the D key is pressed
    playerStop will stop the character from moving happen when no key is pressed.
    playerWin will display an alert when the player beats the game
    playerLoss will display an alert that the player lost and will ask the player to try again.
    playerScore will be a function that enables the user to score
    winnerMessage will display a message saying the user has won and prompt them to try again
    loserMessage will display a message saying the user has lost and will prompt them to try again

Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```


### MVP Criteria

- Your game must be winnable and clearly shows there’s a winner.
  -The winner will have a message pop up once they score the goal
- You must provide clear, easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.
  -Instructions provided will tell user to used WASD keys to move


### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
    A nice background
- Another that will be a stretch.
    randomized moving NPC's
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... _yet_. :)
